# CHALLENGE - CONCURSO DE PREGUNTAS Y RESPUESTAS

Response to the proposed challenge:
The initial idea was to create a REST API with django to consume it with an app in react, due to the time the API was created and the app was created entirely in django.

In my free time I will also make the version with react.

With the following environment you can run the django app with a simple "python manage.py runserver"

Good Luck!!
